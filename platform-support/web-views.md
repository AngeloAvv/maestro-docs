# Web Views

Maestro supports mobile applications that rely on Web Views, both on Android and iOS, including embedded Web Views as well as standalone browser apps (such as, but not limited to, Safari or Chrome). No special configuration is required.

Maestro can be used to test web applications running on mobile or on a desktop. For more information on desktop support refer to [web-desktop-browser.md](web-desktop-browser.md "mention")
