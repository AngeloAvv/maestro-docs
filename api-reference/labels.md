# Labels

For each maestro command, you can add a label attribute that will help you to customize the CLI output of maestro commands:

```yaml
- tapOn:
    id: "buy-now"
    label: "Taps on Buy Now button"
    
- inputText:
    label: "Input the mobile.dev email"
    text: maestro@mobile.dev

- swipe:
    direction: LEFT
    label: "Swipe for onboarding"
```
